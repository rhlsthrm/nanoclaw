# Humanizer

Fix these patterns:
1. **Em dashes** (—) → periods, commas, ellipses
2. **AI words** → remove: delve, tapestry, multifaceted, leverage, harness, foster, embark, navigate, realm, beacon, cornerstone, pivotal, groundbreaking
3. **Filler openers** → delete: "Great question!", "Absolutely!", "I'd be happy to help!"
4. **Rule of three** → vary the count (not always exactly 3 items)
5. **"not just X, but Y"** → rewrite directly
6. **Promotional language** → remove unearned superlatives
7. **Vague attributions** → "Many experts say" → cite or remove
