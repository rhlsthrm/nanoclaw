# Mythology Channel — Visual Style Guide

## Core Style
**Vibrant Digital Illustration / Indian Comic Art**
- Inspired by: Amar Chitra Katha + modern anime + epic fantasy illustration
- NOT photorealistic — stylized, illustrated, colorful
- Bold saturated colors (golds, deep blues, purples, reds, greens)
- Exaggerated dramatic compositions
- Expressive faces with stylized anatomy
- Rich ornamental details (jewelry, weapons, architecture)

## Prompt Suffix (append to every image prompt)
```
vibrant digital illustration style, Indian comic book art, anime-inspired, 
bold saturated colors, dramatic composition, ornate details, 
Amar Chitra Katha meets modern fantasy anime, stylized not photorealistic, 
16:9 aspect ratio
```

## For Shorts (9:16 vertical)
Same style suffix but add:
```
vertical composition, portrait orientation, subject centered
```

## Color Palette
- Gods/Divine: Gold, warm white, celestial blue
- Demons/Asuras: Deep red, black, dark purple  
- Nature/Ocean: Teal, emerald, seafoam
- Fire/Power: Orange, crimson, magenta
- Mystery/Cosmic: Deep purple, indigo, starfield

## Consistency Rules
1. Same style suffix on EVERY prompt
2. Never mix photorealistic and illustrated in same video
3. Characters should look illustrated, not like real people
4. Backgrounds should be painterly, not photographic
5. Lighting can be dramatic but colors stay saturated (no desaturated/muted palettes)

## What to Avoid
- Photorealistic faces (uncanny valley)
- Muted/dark palettes (mythology should feel EPIC and vibrant)
- Western fantasy aesthetic (keep it distinctly Indian)
- Generic anime style, blend with Indian art traditions

## Writing Rules
- No em dashes. Use periods, commas, or ellipses instead.
- No "Great question!", "Absolutely!", or filler openers.
- Short punchy sentences. Narration should hit like a story, not an essay.
- Avoid AI-isms: "delve", "tapestry", "multifaceted", "it's worth noting"
- Run all copy through humanizer patterns before finalizing.
